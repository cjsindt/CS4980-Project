- NPIs during COVID19
- Vector borne diseases
- Vaccine allocation under threshold style models


NPIs and Influenza:
	- CDC FluView has tons of influenza data over time
	- Can compare previous endemics with 20-21, 21-22, 22-23 seasons
	- Maybe predict future endemics
	- Overall increased caution from COVID-19 to help with disease spread?
	- Match strain data between seasons; some strains might spread more easily than others
